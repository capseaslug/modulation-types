Of course, I'll provide the information you've requested. Let's start with the first modulation technique:

**Amplitude Modulation (AM):**

Equation:
```plaintext
x(t) = A * (1 + mi * m(t)) * cos(2 * π * fc * t)
```

Parameters:
- `A`: Amplitude of the carrier signal.
- `fc`: Carrier frequency.
- `mi`: Modulation index.
- `m(t)`: Message signal.

Additional Data:
- Modulation Type: Amplitude Modulation (AM)
- Carrier Waveform: Sinusoidal
- Modulating Waveform: Sinusoidal, Sawtooth
- Applications: AM radio broadcasting, long-distance communication
- Common Broadcasting Power: 1 kW to 50 kW
- Inverse Demodulation Equation: `m(t) = x(t) / (A * (1 + mi * m(t)))`

Next, let's move on to the second modulation technique:

**Frequency Modulation (FM):**

Equation:
```plaintext
x(t) = A * cos(2 * π * fc * t + k * integral(signal, dt))
```

Parameters:
- `A`: Amplitude of the carrier signal.
- `fc`: Carrier frequency.
- `k`: Frequency modulation sensitivity.
- `signal`: Modulating signal.

Additional Data:
- Modulation Type: Frequency Modulation (FM)
- Carrier Waveform: Sinusoidal
- Modulating Waveform: Sinusoidal
- Applications: FM radio broadcasting, analog TV broadcasting
- Common Broadcasting Power: 1 kW to 100 kW
- Inverse Demodulation Equation: Demodulation of FM signals involves complex signal processing and is usually performed using FM demodulators.

Please let me know when you're ready for the next modulation technique.
